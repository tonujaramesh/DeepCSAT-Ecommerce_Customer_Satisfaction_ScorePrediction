# ðŸ›’ DeepCSATâ€“Ecommerce Customer Satisfaction Score Prediction

DeepCSAT is a deep learningâ€“based regression model designed to predict Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores for an e-commerce platform based on customer support data.
The project combines data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model development to discover the key drivers of customer happiness and enable proactive decision-making.

By leveraging interaction data â€” such as response time, issue category, product details, and customer feedback â€” the model predicts satisfaction scores and identifies operational bottlenecks.
